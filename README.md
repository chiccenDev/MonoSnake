# MonoSnake by chiccen

### Description

MonoSnake is a project designed to teach me to use the [MonoGame framework](https://monogame.net/), famous for being the framework used to create hit games such as [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) and [Fez](https://fezgame.com/).

The game itself is intended to be a spin-off of the classic 1988 game Snake, developed by Taneli Armanto for Nokia phones.  
The goal is to spin the original concept into a rogue-like, as I am a fan of the genre. Snake was chosen as the game to spin-off as it is simple enough as a baseline, yet leaves room for plenty of exciting extra features.  

As of writing, the game is only in a mostly playable state. I have much to learn, and have little formal education in C# and many of the complex systems that govern a game as a deliverable product. The intent is to release the game either for free or for as cheap as reasonably possible on Steam.  

Another major benefit of choosing Snake as a baseline is the simplistic art. Having no background in art, simple square pixels are ideal to work with. That said, I do hope to improve my artistic abilities and implement some more creative designs as I develop the game itself.
